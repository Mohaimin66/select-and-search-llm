# Codex Project Instructions

These rules apply to all work in this repository.

## Repo + Git Hygiene
- Ensure a GitHub repo exists before writing code.
- Commit in small, meaningful checkpoints and push after each checkpoint.
- Each commit must include a clear summary and scope.

## Testing and Verification
- Always add or update unit tests for new logic.
- Add integration tests for cross-module flows when applicable.
- Run the relevant test suites locally and report results.
- Manually verify UI changes (smoke checklist).
- If tests cannot run, document the blocker and request what is needed.

## Documentation
- Keep `PLAN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `CHECKPOINTS.md` updated.
- Add/update `SMOKE_TESTS.md` for manual verification steps.

## Permissions
- Ask before running commands that require elevated permissions or external tools.
